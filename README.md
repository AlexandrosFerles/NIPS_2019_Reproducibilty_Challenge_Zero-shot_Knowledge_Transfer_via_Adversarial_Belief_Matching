# NIPS 2019 Reproducibilty Challenge "Zero-shot Knowledge Transfer via Adversarial Belief Matching"

Our code for the [Reproducibility Challenge](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2019/Reproducibility_Challenge) of the 2019 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.

We participate in the Replication Track with the paper [Zero-shot Knowledge Transfer via Adversarial Belief Matching
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09768). 

## Use our pretrained teachers

We have pretrained 4 variants of WideResNet (WRN-16-1, WRN-16-2, WRN-40-1, WRN-40-2) in CIFAR10 and SVHN to use them as students in the Knowledge Transfer setting. You can find these scratces [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uy8qi0unr9n2ad7/AAD_cKvwwxVLvJZ2z8rZQgZ8a?dl=0) and you can place them in the path ```src/PyTorch/PreTrainedModels```. 

Instructions on how to run them will follow!
